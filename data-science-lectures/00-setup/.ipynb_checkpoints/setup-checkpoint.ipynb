    "A text editor refers to any form of computer program that enables users to create, change, edit, open and view plain text files. It will help you write code through its main features which are:\n",
    "- Syntax highlighting: allows users to colour code text based on the programming language it is written;\n",
    "- Intelligent code completion: A context-aware software that speeds up the coding process by reducing typos, correcting common mistakes and offering auto-completion suggestions for syntax errors;\n",
    "- Snippets: enables users to quickly substitute longer pieces of content or code with a shortcut phrase;\n",
    "- Code folding: Also called expand and collapse, the code folding feature hides or displays certain sections of code or text, allowing for a streamlined and decluttered display – great for if you’re working on a long program;\n",
    "- Vertical selection editing: A useful tool that enables users to select, edit or add to multiple lines of code simultaneously;"
